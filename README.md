# Swift
Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc, and the open-source community.
Swift is built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns.
The goal of the Swift project is to create the best available language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop apps,
scaling up to cloud services. Most importantly, Swift is designed to make writing and maintaining correct programs easier for the developer.
Swift is intended as a replacement for **C-based languages** *(C, C++, and Objective-C)*, Swift works with Apple's **Cocoa** and **Cocoa Touch** frameworks,
It is built with the open source **LLVM compiler** framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014.
On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows **C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code** to run within one program.


### Features:

Swift includes features that make code easier to read and write, while giving the developer the control needed in a true systems programming language.
Swift supports inferred types to make code cleaner and less prone to mistakes, and modules eliminate headers and provide namespaces. Memory is managed
automatically, and you donâ€™t even need to type semi-colons. Swift also borrows from other languages, for instance named parameters brought forward
from *Objective-C* are expressed in a clean syntax that makes *APIs* in Swift easy to read and maintain, Swift is Safe, Fast and Expressive Languauge.

The features of Swift are designed to work together to create a language that is powerful, yet fun to use. Some additional features of Swift include:

- Closures unified with function pointers
- Tuples and multiple return values
- Generics
- Optionals and Chaining
- Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection
- Protocol-oriented programming
- Structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols
- Functional programming patterns, e.g., map and filter
- Powerful error handling built-in
- Advanced control flow with `do`, `guard`, `defer`, and `repeat` keywords

### Platform Support:
One of the most exciting aspects of developing Swift in the open is knowing that it is now free to be ported across a wide range of platforms,
devices, and use cases.
 
#### Apple Platforms:
Open-source Swift can be used on the Mac to target all of the Apple platforms: iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Moreover, binary builds of open-source
Swift integrate with the Xcode developer tools, including complete support for the Xcode build system, code completion in the editor, and integrated
debugging, allowing anyone to experiment with the latest Swift developments in a familiar Cocoa and Cocoa Touch development environment.

#### Linux:
Open-source Swift can be used on Linux to build Swift libraries and applications. The open-source binary builds provide the Swift compiler and standard
library, Swift REPL and debugger (LLDB), and the core libraries, so one can jump right in to Swift development.
